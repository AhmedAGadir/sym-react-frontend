- could give teams, members ID's, will think about this (problem with persistence)
- could sanitize/validate breadcrumb component 

- teams need an id, for mapping purposes - cant use 

- team not found error handling
- saving and cancelling edits - requires saving editing state, 
    ive kept this out for simplicities sake
- persisting state 

- havent handled validating for same member across 
    different teams - its because i havent given id's

- refactor getValidationError to use the hooks, 

- refactor pages or hooks so that we dont have to load everything upon updating

- on changing team name a lot needs to happen - maybe update the current route

// this could be improved to navigate to the new team page

// if app grew: 
// edit mode can become more modular - editing name, individual rows etc.
