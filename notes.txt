- could give teams, members ID's, will think about this (problem with persistence)
- could sanitize/validate breadcrumb component 

- teams need an id, for mapping purposes - cant use 

- team not found error handling
- saving and cancelling edits - requires saving editing state, 
    ive kept this out for simplicities sake
- persisting state 

- havent handled validating for same member across 
    different teams - its because i havent given id's
