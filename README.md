## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have Node.js installed, download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedAGadir/sym-react-frontend.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd sym-react-frontend-main
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run client-install
```

### Running the Project

To start the backend server:

```bash
npm run server
```

To start the frontend client:

```bash
npm run client
```

To run both the server and client concurrently (for development):

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Structure

- `main.js`: Entry point for the backend server.
- `frontend`: Directory for the frontend client.

### Scripts

- `start`: Starts the backend server using Node.
- `server`: Runs the backend server with Nodemon for auto-reloading.
